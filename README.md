# My Scripts
varios scripts that I use in configs, helper scripts, etc.  
This directory is added to path to run easily  
All files are shell scripts even if they have no extention  

## cdd, cddr, cddra
These scripts need to be source run to work  
e.g.: $ . cdd  
My shell has aliases to interpret running the script as source running the script for convenience
